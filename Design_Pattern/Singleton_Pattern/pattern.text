⭐ Singleton Pattern — 

Singleton ensures only one object (instance) of a class exists in the entire program.

Why we use it?

When exactly one instance is needed (database connection, logger, printer manager, configuration settings).

Key Points:

Private constructor

One static object inside the class

Public static method to return that single object

Example Idea:

Only one WeatherStationControlCenter should exist → Singleton.
