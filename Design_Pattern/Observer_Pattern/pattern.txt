⭐ Observer Pattern — Short Explanation
Definition:

Observer pattern allows one-to-many notification.
When one object (Observable/Subject) changes, it automatically notifies all registered objects (Observers).

Why we use it?

When multiple objects need updates from one central object
(ex: weather updates, stock prices, notification systems).

Key Points:

Observable keeps a list of observers

Observers register/unregister

When data changes → notify all observers

Example Idea:

WeatherStation updates → all Mobile apps, smartwatches, dashboards update instantly.
